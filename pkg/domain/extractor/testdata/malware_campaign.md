# Advanced Malware Campaign Targeting Financial Institutions

Security researchers have uncovered a sophisticated malware campaign targeting banks and financial institutions worldwide. The campaign, active since January 2024, uses multiple attack vectors and custom malware families.

## Attack Infrastructure

The threat actors operate a network of command-and-control (C2) servers:

- **Primary C2**: 198.51.100.42 (identified as the main control server)
- **Backup C2**: evil-finance-server.xyz (domain used for fallback communications)
- **Phishing infrastructure**: https://secure-banking-verify.net/login (fake banking portal)

## Malware Samples

Analysts identified several malicious payloads:

- **Trojan dropper**: SHA256 hash `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
- **Credential stealer**: MD5 hash `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`
- **Backdoor component**: File hash (SHA1) `aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d`

## Attack Methodology

The campaign begins with spear-phishing emails sent from attacker-controlled addresses like `support@secure-banking-verify.net`. Recipients are directed to download a malicious executable hosted at `http://198.51.100.42/downloads/update.exe`.

## Legitimate References

For more details on email security best practices, see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321.

The malware communicates using DNS tunneling, similar to techniques described at https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2 (note: this is a legitimate security research tool, not malware).

## Recommendations

Organizations should block the identified infrastructure and update their detection rules. Contact your vendor or visit https://www.microsoft.com/security for additional guidance.
